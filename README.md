# microfrontends

This PoC(Proof of Concept) was done with the [Module Federation(Webpack.js)](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).

The [Micro-Frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/) approach allow for more flexible and scalable code development across my work and will enable each team to work independently.
