# Micro-Frontends
<h2>Motivation</h2>

Since most of my work with FinTech is scaling up their eCommerce Business. I need to ensure my work have a strong foundation. The [Micro-Frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/) approach allow for more flexible and scalable code development across my work and will enable each team to work independently.  This scale-up work is normally part of a bigger programme that includes things like a search engine optimization(SEO) of an online store, a strong marketing strategy and a scale-up of the customer service.<br>
Meaning we should only consider this approach for FinTech of a certain dimension and organization. Some times it's better to have a large frontend monolith application. 

<h2>Proof of Concept</h2>

This PoC(Proof of Concept) was done with the [Module Federation(Webpack.js)](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).
